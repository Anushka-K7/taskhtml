     <p><strong>Albert Einstein</strong> was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany. </p>
<p>Albert Einstein's most significant work includes the theory of relativity, which revolutionized the way we understand space, time, and gravity. His Special<i> Theory of Relativity</i>, published in 1905, introduced the famous equation <br> <b>"E = mcÂ²"</b>, demonstrating the relationship between mass and energy. In <b>1915</b>, <br>Einstein published his General Theory of Relativity, which provided a new understanding of gravity as the curvature of spacetime. He also made substantial contributions to quantum theory, including his explanation of the photoelectric effect, which earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.</p>
